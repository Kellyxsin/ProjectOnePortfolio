      <h1>Kelly Sin</h1>
      <img src="img/Me.jpg">
      <p> Kelly loves being a designer/artist because she gets to create and show 
         her work as something to fulfill her life. She wants to learn more because 
         she is in the beginning stages of what it is to be in the creative field of 
         design. Kelly still feels that she is in the beginning stages of her major in 
         design but is actually in the middle. Everything is going so fast for her and 
         she worries a lot. She does not know what truly inspires her because she has a 
         hard time figuring out what really likes. She thinks too much of the details but 
         has some goals. Her goals so far are to graduate college and to find a job that 
         has something to do with graphic design. Kelly is from San Francisco and has never 
         left. Also, she came from a humble background and is trying her best to be herself 
         and never become naive. This has made her who she is today because of her family 
         and friends that keep her grounded. They always tell her to be respectful towards 
         others and to act bold and tough. Kelly has tried to act bold and tough like her 
         family but she has social anxiety. After Kelly graduates, she wants to find a job 
         that is related to her creative field. Before that she needs connections and builds 
         a community of designers who are on the same boat as her. Kelly feels that things 
         should slow down because of some anxiety that goes into this type of major. It is 
         tough because after college, she would become indecisive but figure out things at 
         the same time. Kelly is trying to be more passionate about design because it is 
         interesting and she wants to know more in a step by step process. </p>
